# Understanding-Cancer-Mortality-Trends-USA-Analysis 
Conducted comprehensive analysis of cancer mortality in the USA, a crucial indicator of public health, using advanced statistical methods. 📊 Explored factors influencing cancer mortality rates, including demographics, socioeconomic factors, and healthcare access.

🛠 Employed Multiple Linear Regression to model mortality rates based on various independent variables, such as income, education, and ethnicity.

🔍 Utilized Python for data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and outlier detection, ensuring the reliability of analysis results.

📈 Assessed model assumptions and diagnostics, including linearity and homoscedasticity, to validate statistical rigor and model accuracy.

💡 This project sheds light on the complex dynamics of cancer mortality, providing insights to inform public health policies and interventions.🔬 Conducted comprehensive analysis of cancer mortality in the USA, a crucial indicator of public health, using advanced statistical methods. 📊 Explored factors influencing cancer mortality rates, including demographics, socioeconomic factors, and healthcare access. 🛠 Employed Multiple Linear Regression to model mortality rates based on various independent variables, such as income, education, and ethnicity. 🔍 Utilized Python for data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and outlier detection, ensuring the reliability of analysis results. 📈 Assessed model assumptions and diagnostics, including linearity and homoscedasticity, to validate statistical rigor and model accuracy. 💡 This project sheds light on the complex dynamics of cancer mortality, providing insights to inform public health policies and interventions.
